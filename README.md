Game development, once considered a technological oddity at science fairs in the 1950s, has blossomed into one of the most profitable entertainment industries in the world today. (Why Video Games Succeed Where The Movie And Music Industries Fail (fastcompany.com))

At the New York World's Fair in 1940, Dr. Edward Uhler Condon unveiled the first example of a game machine. During its six-month run, approximately 50,000 people played the game, which was based on the ancient mathematical game Nim . More than 90 percent of games were won by the computer.

Gamers are no longer solely young people who enjoy video games. The average age of a gamer is increasing as generations grow up with video games as a part of life. During a 2021 survey, 38 percent of video game players still come from the 18 to 34 age demographic, and seven percent are 65 years and older.(â€¢ U.S. average age of video gamers 2021 | Statista)

Everything is being digitized today and most of the games are bought and downloaded from the internet on platforms such as Steam, Origin, Uplay and so on. Sometimes, games are not accessible to everybody due to different problematic factors such as slow internet connection which will take up to two or three days to finish downloading a large file game. Other individuals prefer the disc version to avoid waiting to download again after it got deleted because of various factors like losing interest or low storage, and having a disc copy is a safe and fast method to reinstall the game. Additionally, there are individuals that are still using a DVD-RW drive and still want to take advantage of that hardware so the disc version will be the most fiable option.

The solution to this problem is to bring back the disc version games via an online system that lets you buy the desired title and use it offline. The development of the system includes creating a system with a database and a business logic part where the options can be displayed for different game titles, the user being able to order them and get them delivered.

Therefore, the decision of creating an online store for physical games has been taken. According to the statistics, this is still a big lucrative area which will be helping gamers collect and enjoy their games on a cd.
